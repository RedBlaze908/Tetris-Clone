## Tetris Multiplayer
This project is made only for fun and with the purpose of learn new things,
so all the credits of the game are reserved by the owner.

My idea was simple, i wanted to recreate tetris in c++ with SFML library (2.6.1)
and try to implement the multiplayer (Work in progress).

Feel free to use some piece of the code in your project, or to take ispiration
from what i have made.
